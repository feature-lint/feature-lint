# Why Feature-lint

When working in a team, the most important thing is **to ensure everyone does things the same way**.
This starts with formatting the code (e.g. using [prettier](prettier.io)) and ends that everyone
names the files according to the naming conventions.

But, from an architectural perspective, it may also be necessary, that **imports** are ensured and 
the architectural principles don't get violated.

Although there exist code formatters like prettier and linters, like eslint, folder structure and
architectural aspects are often not recognized as first-class-citizen.
This is the gap feature-lint fills. Feature-lint's goal is to ensure, that folder structures,
naming conventions and architectural rules are adhered to - by everyone in the team. Automatically.
