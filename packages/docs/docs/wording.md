# Wording
:::caution

This document is under construction

:::

When talking about concepts, it is nessesary to get the wording right. 
In the documentation the following wording is used:

**package**: A package is an npm-package. This means a folder, containing a package.json as well 
as a node_modules folder. A package kann be released to npm.

**module**: A module is a "typescript"-file, containing typescript code (=a typescript module)

**building-block**: A building block is an abstract term for a generic component (not UI-Component) of a piece
of software. In a react world, a component may actually a building block, but also hooks or angular services
could be building blocks. Comming from a redux-perspective, actions or reducer could also form building-blocks.

**feature-type**: A feature-type is just abstract a collection of building-blocks.
